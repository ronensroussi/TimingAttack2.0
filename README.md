A project for the course "Attacks on Implementations of Secure Systems".


the assignment was as follows:


     A password-checking website has been set up at the address: http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il
     You access the website with your username (your ID number) and with a password. It returns 1 if the password is correct. In addition, there is an additional difficulty parameter which makes the assignment progressively harder (up to 10). Note that students who can crack the highest difficulty within 1 minute get bonus points (the exact amount will be determined according to the performance of all teams), for example:
     http://aoi.ise.bgu.ac.il/?user=albert&password=perot&difficulty=1

     Your mission is to find the password corresponding to your id number, in the highest difficulty level in the least time.
